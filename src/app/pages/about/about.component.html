                        <p>An apartment building or block of flats may have a few or many apartments. Each apartment is a separate room or set of rooms for people to live in. Sometimes an apartment will only be one small room, and tenants will have to share other rooms like the bathroom and kitchen. Other times, tenants will only share an entrance hallway with different doors leading to each apartment. This shared area is often cared for by a janitor or caretaker.
                            An apartment, flat, or unit, is a self-contained housing unit that occupies part of a building, generally on a single story. There are many names for these overall buildings, see below.
